Similar to stickers on iOS messages, this mac app allows you to create stickers from screenshots or existing images quickly.

It's pretty self explanatory, but there are 3 main components: a sticker manager, editor, and popover. You can edit and view your sticker collections in the manager, cut-out stickers from screen captures using the editor, and easily insert images into any textfield.

### Roadmap:
* create a unified marketplace (web app) of stickers that can be downloaded easily
* rewrite code and fix bugs lol
