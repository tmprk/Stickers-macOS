> ⚠️ **I paused development on this project a while ago (after the MVP was developed).** I haven't been able to dedicate much time to updating it for Big Sur and Monterrey because I started to learn web development and I'm taking classes for school. I hope to get back to work on this project again soon! In the meantime, feel free to contribute or make a fork. 02-01-22

Similar to stickers on iOS messages, this mac app allows you to create stickers from screenshots or existing images quickly.

There are 3 main components: a sticker manager, editor, and popover. You can edit and view your sticker collections in the manager, cut-out stickers from screen captures using the editor, and easily insert images into any textfield.

### Roadmap:

* rewrite code and fix bugs lol
